# Linux Driver Cheat

This project contains a kernel module that can be used to perform memory operations on an arbitrary process on a linux system from a usermode client. This can be used to bypass countermeasures and to hide from detection mechanisms of anti-cheat systems. This project is a bit older but at the time of creation this was more than enough to bypass BattlEye and probably all other existing anti-cheat solutions for linux systems. I wrote a small example client which prints an a list of items and its distance to the player as a PoC.
